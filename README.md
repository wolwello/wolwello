Hi, I’m @wolwello (Wolmorry)

I’m a Syndey dwelling, Australian Aboriginal ESVC (Early Stage Venture Capital) enthusiast as well as an Investor Relations Coordinator interested in automation with Java,Python and Data Management with MySql and Excel.

I’m currently learning basic software development as a way to leverage my current buisness experience within more operational based roles at other companies, aswell as potentially being able to pivot from my current career field. 
I am a huge enthusiast in the field of engineering- whether that be mechanical or software, I often find my self in over my head when I'm 2 hours deep into researching topics that are otherwise much too advanced for me to possibly ascertain the usefulness of.

Currently I have no plans of coworking with other people - although if you have the chance I would love to hear what you would improve in my code.

You can reach me at:

And for investment information:

Thanks for reading! <3
